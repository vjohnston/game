Overview
#####################

We present a simplified version of the popular strategy board game, Stratego. In this game there are two players, each with 10 pieces. One of these pieces is a flag, and each player's goal to discover their opponent's flag. Players are only able to see the locations of the opposing player's pieces but not their type. To begin the game each player places thier pieces in the lower 3 rows of the board. Once both players have submitted their initial setup, they take turns moving pieces. Most pieces can move one space at a time. The exception to this are the flag and bombs cannot move and the 9 piece can move any number of vacant spaces in a single direction. When one piece discovers another piece, the higher number piece is killed and removed from the board, excluding the excptions described below. When a piece discovers their opponent's flag, the discovering player wins and the game is over. The list below details the characteristics of each player.

F - The Flag
The Flag cannot move and can be captured by all moving pieces. When the flag is captured the game is won.

1 - The McMillan
	The McMillan captures all other pieces but can be defeated by the Bualuan.

2 - The Flynn
	The Flynn defeats all lower ranked pieces, but can be defeated by the McMillan.

8 - The Bowyer
	The Bowyer can defuse bombs, but it is captured by all lower-ranked pieces.

9 - The Bui
	The Bui can move any number of vacant spaces forward, backward, left of right.

S - The Bualuan
	The Bualuan can capture the McMillan when attacking, but is captured by all other pieces.

B - The Bomb
	Bombs cannot move and destroy any attacking pieces, except for the Bowyer.

Gameplay
#####################

Each player places their 10 pieces within the lower three rows of the board. After the player has done this, they click the "ready" button. Once both players have done this, the red team will be prompted to move first by the lack of "waiting for opponent" message. The red player chooses where to make their first move. The blue player will then be prompted to move in the same manner. This gameplay will continue until a flag has been discovered. A notification will display on each player's screen indicating that they've won or lost. To close the game at anypoint, a player can click the X button in the upper righthand corner. This will end the game for both players and both windows will be closed; however, the game server will continue running.
